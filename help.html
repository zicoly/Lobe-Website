            <div class="contain">
                <p>Machine learning is software that learns to perform a task from a collection of examples rather than
                    through
                    a person explicitly defining rules and formulas. This learning software is called a model. Teaching
                    a
                    model
                    through examples is called training.

                <p>This version of Lobe learns to look at images using <strong>image classification</strong> -
                    categorizing
                    an
                    image into a single label overall. We are working to expand to more types of problems and data in

                <p>Image classification is categorizing an image into a single label to represent its content. Apps

                    image

            <div class="contain">
                <p>A model is a piece of code. You can export your model into a variety of industry-standard formats to
                    run
                    on Mac and Windows, the web, or mobile and edge devices. You can also export and use your model in
                    Power
                    Platform. See our GitHub for sample projects and other tools for working with Lobe. We are also
                    working
                    on a collection of apps and integrations to help run your model without any code.
